# Mike's Frustration-Free Seven Step Software Development Strategy
### by Mike

---

Useful when specification is constant (not ongoing development)


1. Specify - what is the domain and range (complete inputs and outputs)
2. Design - how, and what is hte test plan
3. Implement - should already be designed, just typing
4. Predict - what should my program produce before running blindly
5. Execute - run the code
6. Visualize and Analyze - what is expected, what are you getting over a range of inputs (print, unit test, debugger, assert, possibly plot)
7. Subdivide & Redesign - try to isolate sections of the code and redesign, testing just those
